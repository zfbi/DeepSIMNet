# DeepISMNet: using synthetic datasets to train an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network for implicit structural modeling
Three-Dimensional Implicit Structural Modeling Using Convolutional Neural Network

**This is a [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) version of a deep learning method using a convolution neural network to predict a scalar field from sparse structural data associated with multiple distinct stratigraphic layers and faults.

## Requirements

```
python>=3.6
torch>=1.0.0
torchvision
torchsummary
natsort
numpy
pillow
plotly
pyparsing
scipy
scikit-image
sklearn
tqdm
```
Install all dependent libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset

**To train our CNN, we automatically created numerous structural models and the associated data with distinct stratigraphic layers and faults, which were shown to be sufficient to obtain an excellent structural modeling network.** 

**The synthetic structural models can be downloaded from [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6480165), and the input data are randomly generated in training.**

Run training_data_generating.ipynb to create a new synthetic dataset.

## Training

Run train.ipynb to start training a new DeepISMNet model by using the synthetic dataset.
